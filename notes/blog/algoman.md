# Algoman

[Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) is a great tool for writing cross-platform 2D games in Golang.
It's very easy to converted my old canvas [algorithm visualizer](algorithm-visualization-refactoring.md) into it. Now I can 
build it for all major platforms.

[jsgo](https://jsgo.io/) is another awesome tool for using golang with GopherJS. It compiles the go (GopherJS) lib into js, serve and cache it. 
Then you can easily see the [result](https://jsgo.io/lei-cao/programming/code/algoman)

Loading it as a simple `iframe` in Vuepress:

I gave it a final name too.
 
 `Algoman` - An interactive game for learning algorithms. 
 
 I will visualise all the major algorithms and made it as a game for learning algorithms.
 
> After writing in Vuepress for couple of weeks, I really loved it. So much fun to blogging and coding at the same time! Just powerful! 
 Waiting for the official blog theme support.
