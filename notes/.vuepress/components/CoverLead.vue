I'm excited to apply for the Technical Solutions, Team Lead (APAC) role at StackAdapt.

In my current role as Senior Partner Product Manager at AppLovin, I collaborate with multiple stakeholders to manage the product lifecycle, working closely with leading mobile device OEMs including Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Samsung and Realme and carriers to integrate our products. A key part of my role involves leveraging BigQuery, Looker, and App Scripts for product performance monitoring and custom reporting, aligning with the qualifications mentioned in your job description.

Prior to this, I held a leadership role at Remerge as a Solutions Engineer Lead. Here, I successfully led a team focused on complex tech integrations for APAC-based clients including prominent names like Shopee, Grab, and AliExpress. I developed the Template Manager using Go, React.js and firebase, streamlining the dynamic template creation process, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ad banner creation. This experience honed my technical leadership and problem-solving skills.

During my Senior Solutions Engineer role at Criteo, I had the opportunity to work with multiple technologies like Go, Vue, WebSocket, ElasticSearch, and more. I developed a user-friendly dashboard that improved app integration efficiency and served as an internal technical expert for Mobile Measurement Partners.
